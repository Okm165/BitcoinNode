need to make a system that provdes iformation about number of addresses that have value above or below certain threshold
how to achieve it ?
it would be nice that the system can fulfill request about any arbitratry threshold, not only fixed values like 10, 100, 1000


concept 1:
in every block make a second DB with amount as a key it will satisfy all above requirements
system is frendly for external user because it is moderatly fast

cons:   significant increase in static memory usage

concept 2:


it would be useful to develop some sort of db format .dict
first varint is number of rows in dict
every row consits of :
    varint length to read <key>
    varint length to read <value>

it is better to store large dicts in ldbs 
due to high deserialization/ serialization times


amount key address number value dictionary
not big save as .dict
key is amount::: value is nuber of addresses that have this particular amount
"""amountDb"""

ordered dictionary done and saved in .dict file
to go back chainstate we need to update records in this dict 
if value exists remove 1 from prev place and add 1 to current place
if does not exists use insertion alg to add new value in right place and add 1

performing extensive tests on addresDb and amountDb
